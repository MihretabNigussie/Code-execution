# Getting Started with MyPythonApp

Welcome to MyPythonApp, an open-source project designed to provide advanced image processing capabilities. This guide will walk you through the steps needed to install and run MyPythonApp on your system.

## System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation Instructions

### Using pip

The easiest way to install MyPythonApp is using pip. Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux) and run the following command:

```bash
pip install MyPythonApp
```

### From Source

If you prefer to install from source, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyPythonApp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd MyPythonApp
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Initial Setup and Configuration

Once the installation is complete, you may need to perform some initial setup:

1. If MyPythonApp requires any configuration files, they will typically be located in a `config` directory. Follow the instructions in the `README` file within that directory to set up your configuration.

2. To verify that MyPythonApp has been installed correctly, you can run a simple diagnostic check by executing:

   ```bash
   MyPythonApp --check
   ```

   This will run a series of tests and output the results to your terminal.

## Running MyPythonApp

To run MyPythonApp, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
MyPythonApp
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to process your images.

Congratulations! You are now ready to use MyPythonApp for your image processing needs.
