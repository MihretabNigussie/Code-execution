## Getting Started

Welcome to MyPythonApp! This section will guide you through the installation and setup process to get you up and running with our advanced image processing features.

### System Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

To install MyPythonApp, you can use pip. Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any other terminal) and type the following command:

```shell
pip install MyPythonApp
```

This will download and install MyPythonApp along with its dependencies.

### Initial Setup

Once the installation is complete, you're ready to start using MyPythonApp. If your project requires any initial configuration, such as setting up environment variables or creating a configuration file, please follow the instructions below:

1. Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`) in the root directory of your project. Here is an example of what the contents might look like:

```json
{
    "image_directory": "path/to/images",
    "output_directory": "path/to/output",
    "default_format": "png"
}
```

2. Replace the placeholder values with the actual paths and settings you wish to use.

3. To run MyPythonApp, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to process images, and execute the following command:

```shell
MyPythonApp --config config.json
```

Replace `config.json` with the path to your actual configuration file if necessary.

### Running the Application

To use MyPythonApp for image processing, you can execute the following command:

```shell
MyPythonApp --input /path/to/images --output /path/to/output --format jpg
```

This will process the images in the specified input directory, save the results to the output directory, and use the jpg format for the output images.

### Support and Feedback

If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please open an issue on our GitHub repository or contact us directly.
